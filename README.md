## Building in Visual Studio
1. Clone the repository with submodules: `git clone --recurse-submodules <repo-url>`
2. Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution (`Ctrl+Shift+B`).
- Eigen is included in `extern/eigen/` and configured in the project settings.

- Update submodules: git submodule update --init --recursive
